# codemirror-ot
Real-time collaboration plugin for CodeMirror 6.

At its core this library is a translator between [JSON Operational Transformation](https://github.com/ottypes/json0) and [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/) transactions.

This is one piece of the puzzle for enabling real-time collaboration on text documents using [ShareDB](https://github.com/teamwork/sharedb).
